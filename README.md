# Glitch Gang Agent Trait Engine

This repository is a local-first metadata parser and intelligence toolkit for the **Glitch Gang NFT project**, part of the broader Project 89 narrative.

## 🌐 Purpose

- Parse metadata from IPFS or JSON endpoints
- Split and structure agent traits (e.g., Secret Code → Level, Number, Group)
- Update agent metadata into a local or cloud SQL database (MariaDB)
- Export `.csv`, `.json`, or `.md` dossiers and trail reports
- Serve as the backend engine for Discord bots, trail dashboards, or lore-generation tools
